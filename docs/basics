  objects:
    cells     // referenced by a uuid,  
    links     // referenced by [cell1.uuid,cell1.port,cell2.uuid,cell2.port]
    tree      // referenced by the root cell's uuid
      branch  // referenced by tree and link
  
  make(n,m) wires up using an agreed topology:
    each cell should be given a 'nice' value to k
    cell will be positioned using k according to the following scheme.:

    k=1  2
      o--o
      |\/|
      |/\|
      o--o  
      3   4

        / | \

  turn on cells and links  // link can only turn on when cells on both ends are on
  link failure  // tbd: cell failure
  makes and repairs trees   ***** the only logic we have to implement
  cells and links states are on/off; when off they are 'missing'
         
client/browser            caches and replays events
  getCells,getLinks,getTrees,   // Gregory: these must be received in order zzz
  cmnds: { make(n,m), killLink(t), subscribe(cell,link,tree), }
